# 42-so_long

Goal of this project is to use [Mlx Library](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) and create small 2D game in which player collects the collectibles, 
and exits out out of the game. The topic was free and up to a student, and mine was Tom and Jerry. And Jerry likes to eat cheese.

[Mlx Library](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) was a new challenge to be tackled on and it was pretty interesting seeing how every pixel matters!
